# Deep learning for (almost) any text classification problem (binary, multi-class, multi-label)

In this video, I will show you how to build a model for (almost) any text classification problem, i.e., binary classification, multi-class classification or multi-label classification. 

You can expand this to any language and any type of deep learning model (LSTM, GRU, Transformers, etc). 

In this video, I will be using BERT model from Transformers and Tez.

You can find Tez here: https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/tez​
